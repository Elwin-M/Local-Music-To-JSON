# Local-Music-To-JSON

A simple GUI for converting local music files to specified JSON format. 
Format and specifics can be changed easily with simple python knowledge so that it can be used with other utilities as required.

A folder with a sample of files is included if curious on the output.

Instructions:
Run the program by double clicking

Select a directory.
It does not recursively search through. 
It will only grab the files in the same folder.
If the folder has hundreds of songs, the program might not respond. That's okay.
Keep waiting and it will be okay.
This message will dissapear if you hit the Display & Save button.
If you have more folders, you can select them afterwards.
The song names will be saved to a text file to be used with the other program.

If there are any issues, please let me know.

Right now, only mp3, m4a formats are supported
